# Ethics, Privacy & Inclusivity

This document outlines the ethical framework, privacy practices, AI safeguards, and inclusivity considerations for **Sapling**, an AI-powered study companion.

---

## 1. Ethical Framework

### Core Principles

Sapling is built on three ethical commitments:

1. **Student autonomy.** The AI guides and scaffolds but never replaces the student's own thinking. All three teaching modes (Socratic, Expository, Teachback) are designed to build genuine understanding, not dependency. Students choose their learning pace, mode, and topics.

2. **Transparency.** Students interact with an AI tutor, not a human. The system is clearly branded as "Sapling" (an AI), and responses are generated by a language model (Gemini). Mastery scores, knowledge graph changes, and quiz assessments are visible and understandable — students can see *why* the system thinks they know or don't know something.

3. **Do no harm.** AI-generated educational content can contain errors. Sapling includes safeguards (detailed below) to reduce misinformation risk, and the system prompt explicitly instructs the AI not to present false information as fact. Students are encouraged to verify information with authoritative sources.

### Potential Harms We Considered

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **AI hallucination** — AI tutor generates incorrect explanations | System prompts instruct the model to admit uncertainty. Teachback mode specifically tests whether students catch AI mistakes, building critical evaluation skills. |
| **Over-reliance on AI** — students stop thinking independently | Socratic mode never gives answers directly. All modes limit direct answers and push students to demonstrate understanding before progressing. |
| **Unfair mastery assessment** — AI misjudges a student's knowledge | Mastery scores are adjusted incrementally (+/- 0.05 to 0.10 per exchange) with both positive and negative signals. Quiz scores provide an independent calibration channel. Students can see and understand their scores. |
| **Social comparison harm** — study room leaderboards create anxiety | Study Match focuses on *complementary* strengths, not ranking. The system identifies what each student can teach others, framing differences as assets rather than deficits. |
| **Data surveillance** — tracking learning behavior feels invasive | All data stays local (SQLite). No analytics, no telemetry, no third-party tracking. Students can see exactly what data exists about them. Data deletion is available via API. |

## 2. Privacy Practices

### What Data We Collect

| Data Type | Purpose | Stored Where |
|---|---|---|
| User profile (name) | Display and personalization | Local SQLite DB |
| Knowledge graph (concepts, mastery scores) | Adaptive learning and recommendations | Local SQLite DB |
| Chat conversation history | Context for AI tutoring sessions | Local SQLite DB |
| Quiz attempts and results | Mastery calibration and adaptive quiz generation | Local SQLite DB |
| Assignment data (from syllabus upload) | Calendar and study planning | Local SQLite DB |
| Google OAuth tokens (optional) | Calendar sync — only if user explicitly connects | Local SQLite DB |

### What We Do NOT Collect

- No email addresses (unless user provides one; not required)
- No IP addresses or location data
- No device fingerprints or browser telemetry
- No analytics or usage tracking
- No data is sent to third parties (except Gemini API calls for AI features, which are subject to [Google's AI Terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms))

### Data Retention & Deletion

- All data is stored locally in a SQLite database on the machine running the backend
- No data is replicated to cloud servers
- Users can request full data deletion via `DELETE /api/users/{user_id}/data`, which removes all user data including conversation history, quiz attempts, knowledge graph, assignments, and OAuth tokens
- The database can be completely reset by deleting `sapling.db` and re-running `init_db.py`

### Third-Party AI (Gemini) Privacy

Sapling sends the following to Google's Gemini API during AI interactions:
- The student's current knowledge graph (concept names and mastery scores)
- Conversation history for the active session
- Quiz generation context

This data is subject to Google's Gemini API terms. We do not send personally identifiable information (names, emails) to Gemini — only academic concept data and conversation content. Users should review [Google's AI data practices](https://ai.google.dev/terms) for details on how API inputs are handled.

### FERPA Awareness

Sapling handles student academic performance data (mastery scores, quiz results, study patterns). In a production deployment within an educational institution:
- The institution would be the data controller under FERPA
- Student consent would be required before collecting learning data
- Access controls would need to be implemented to restrict data visibility
- The current prototype uses a local-only database with no network exposure, which limits FERPA scope

## 3. AI Safeguards

### Content Guardrails

The AI tutor system prompt includes explicit instructions to:

1. **Stay on topic.** Only discuss the academic concept the student is studying. Refuse requests to generate content unrelated to learning.
2. **Admit uncertainty.** If the AI is unsure about a concept, it says so rather than generating potentially incorrect information.
3. **No personal advice.** The AI does not provide medical, legal, financial, or personal advice — it is strictly an academic tutor.
4. **No harmful content.** The system prompt prohibits generating violent, discriminatory, or inappropriate content.
5. **Encourage verification.** The AI periodically reminds students that AI-generated explanations should be cross-referenced with textbooks and authoritative sources.

### Bias Mitigation

- **Pedagogical bias:** Sapling offers three distinct teaching modes to accommodate different learning styles. Students who learn better through questioning (Socratic), direct explanation (Expository), or teaching others (Teachback) all have appropriate options.
- **Assessment bias:** Mastery scoring uses multiple signals (conversation understanding, quiz performance, self-correction) rather than a single metric, reducing the chance of systematic bias against any learning style.
- **Cultural sensitivity:** The AI tutor system prompt instructs the model to use inclusive language, avoid cultural assumptions, and present diverse examples when explaining concepts.
- **Language accessibility:** The AI adapts its language complexity based on the student's demonstrated understanding, avoiding unnecessarily complex vocabulary that could disadvantage non-native English speakers.

### AI Transparency

- The app is clearly branded as an AI tool — "Sapling" is identified as an AI tutor, not a human
- Mastery score calculations are deterministic and visible to the student
- Knowledge graph changes after each interaction are returned to the frontend, so students can see how their understanding is being tracked
- Quiz questions are generated by AI and labeled as such

## 4. Inclusivity

### Learning Style Diversity

Not all students learn the same way. Sapling addresses this through:
- **Socratic mode** for students who learn through guided questioning
- **Expository mode** for students who prefer clear, structured explanations
- **Teachback mode** for students who learn best by teaching others
- **Adaptive quizzes** that adjust difficulty based on demonstrated mastery

### Accessibility Considerations

- The interface uses sufficient color contrast (dark text on light backgrounds) with forest-green accents that meet WCAG AA standards
- Focus-visible outlines are implemented for keyboard navigation
- The knowledge graph provides text-based mastery labels alongside color coding, so information is not conveyed by color alone
- Font sizes are readable (minimum 11px for labels, 13-14px for body text)

### Future Accessibility Roadmap

- ARIA labels for interactive components (knowledge graph nodes, quiz options)
- Screen reader support for chat interactions and quiz feedback
- Mobile-responsive layout for students who access the app on phones
- Multilingual AI tutoring support
- Text-to-speech integration for auditory learners
- High-contrast theme option

### Socioeconomic Accessibility

- Sapling is fully open-source
- Runs on minimal hardware (local SQLite, no cloud infrastructure required)
- The only external dependency is a free Gemini API key
- No subscription fees, no premium tiers, no paywalls

## 5. Responsible AI Development

### What We Know the AI Cannot Do

We are transparent about Sapling's limitations:

1. **The AI is not a replacement for human teachers.** It cannot understand emotional context, recognize when a student is struggling with non-academic issues, or provide the mentorship that human educators offer.
2. **Mastery scores are approximations.** They reflect what the AI observed in conversations and quizzes, not a complete picture of a student's understanding. Students should not treat them as definitive assessments.
3. **The AI can be wrong.** Language models hallucinate. Sapling's Teachback mode partially addresses this by training students to catch AI mistakes, but errors in Socratic and Expository modes can go undetected.
4. **Study matching has limits.** The algorithm pairs students based on complementary knowledge gaps, but productive study partnerships depend on interpersonal factors the algorithm cannot measure.

### Continuous Improvement

- We monitor for common AI failure patterns (repeated incorrect explanations, inappropriate content generation) and update system prompts accordingly
- The quiz context system tracks which question patterns students have already seen, preventing repetitive assessment
- Mastery scores self-correct over time through multiple independent signals (chat, quizzes, teach-back performance)
