You are maintaining learning notes about a student's understanding of a concept.

Concept: {concept_name}
Student: {student_name}

Previous notes (may be empty if first quiz):
{existing_quiz_context_json}

Quiz just completed:
Score: {score}/{total}
Questions and student's answers:
{quiz_results_json}

Based on the quiz results, update your notes. Write analysis about:
- What specific subtopics is the student weak on?
- What misconceptions or common mistakes did they reveal?
- Brief summary of what question themes they've now seen (so you don't repeat them)
- What difficulty should the next quiz be?
- Any other observations that would help you generate a better quiz next time

Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no backticks:
{
  "weak_areas": ["specific subtopic or skill strings"],
  "common_mistakes": ["specific misconception strings"],
  "questions_seen_summary": "brief summary string",
  "recommended_difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
  "notes": "free-form observations string"
}
