Extract all assignments, exams, readings, and deadlines from the following text.

Note: The text was extracted via OCR from a PDF or image and may contain:
- Garbled characters, spacing issues, or line-break artifacts
- Merged or split words caused by OCR errors
- Flattened tables or schedule grids

Be tolerant of OCR noise. Use surrounding context to infer assignment names and dates.
If a year is not explicitly stated, assume 2026.

For each assignment or deadline found, return:
- title: the assignment or exam name (clean up any OCR noise in the title)
- due_date: ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
- course_name: course name or code if identifiable, otherwise empty string
- assignment_type: one of homework, exam, reading, project, quiz, other
- notes: any relevant additional details, or null

Output ONLY valid JSON — no markdown fencing, no backticks, no extra commentary:
{
  "assignments": [
    { "title": "string", "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "course_name": "string", "assignment_type": "string", "notes": "string or null" }
  ],
  "warnings": ["note any ambiguous or uncertain extractions here"]
}
